/* File: background.js
 * -------------------
 * This script defines an event page, which allows you
 * to have a "single long-running script to handle some
 * task or state."
 *
 * The general principle is that this script will register
 * to listen for Chrome events, and then be instantiated
 * when Chrome notices that event.
 *
 * (You don't need to change this file unless you're building
 * an extension.)
 * 
 * Note: Since the event page is created and destroyed many
 * times throughout a browser session, you cannot store
 * instance state in global variables.
 * 
 * An example chrome extension that uses an event page is
 * available at:
 * https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples#search:sandbox
 * 
 * For more details, check out the documentation:
 * https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages
